# Object Oriented Principles

## Notes
* Encapsulation means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
* Inheritance describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class.
* Polymorphism means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
* Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation.
* The abstract keyword enables you to create classes and class members that are incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class.
