# Readme's and Unit Testing

## Thoughts
* Having a well a documented README will help you understand what you are doing. Not just yourself, but others as well.
* Having a TDD approach will improve code, and catching errors or mistakes will be easier.
* Keep tests short and visible. So when a test fails, you want to understand what went wrong.  
* When testing, always arrange, act, assert:
    * Arrange - instantiate object, call a particular constructor, etc.
    * Act - Invoke  method, and cature result. This is where all the arranging lead up to.
    * Assert - assert concept in the unit test represents a general category of action that you cannot omit and have a unit test. Asserting something represents the essence of testing.
