# Reading and Writing Files

## Notes
* Always remember to include Systems.IO
* Some commonly used file and directory classes:

    * File - provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object.

    * FileInfo - provides instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files, and helps create a FileStream object.

    * Directory - provides static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.

    * DirectoryInfo - provides instance methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.

    * Path - provides methods and properties for processing directory strings in a cross-platform manner.
