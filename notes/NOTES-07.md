# Interfaces

## Notes
* Classes does not support multiple lines of inheritance.
* A class however can implement `n` times of interface.
* When implementing interfaces to a class, it tell the class what it can do.  
* The basic problem an interface is trying to solve is to separate how we use something from how it is implemented.
